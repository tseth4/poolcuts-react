## PoolCuts React TypeScript

- Fix Review and submit \*
- Fix new cut form \*

- Email verification token \*

- Sign up form -> submit -> send verification
- Sign up form -> submit -> user (success) || error code with "USER EXISTS"

- login -> please verify email
- login -> invalid user or password

- Api call to resend verification token

- Appointment
- Book -> email to both barber and user
- CancelBook -> email to both barber and user

Need to fix
-> accurate dates on the new appointment form
-> profile dashboard style

service api dns

-> sends email with spa link
spa link will call get request to verify email to verification api service-api-dns/verification
spa url

\*-> should we store user jwt in react context?
-> fix footer, mobile view of sign up, and login is too high

## REST

-> Send email when making an appointment
-> Make the logic for checking user token with their user data resusable inside utils or validation
-> Write tests using the various methods taught during training

-> UserEntity - last login, created on

"http://localhost:3000/passwordreset/" + token
"http://localhost:3000/confirmation/" + token

- theres an art to asserting in testing, finding things that should be true
